Peer Review - Code runs great, couldn't find any bugs, I also like how he used double just in case the user tries spamming a bunch of numbers. Also looking at his code, it's all very simple and concise. The only part he needs to change is the output for enpoint 2, because it says my favorite food is the time that I woke up at, but that's a super easy fix. Overall, great job!
